Some Notes for the project

***Probably better to switch the entire project to python and use flask... :(

Python Part : K - means

1. In order to actually see the plots in windows we have to use plt.show().
2. K is configurable (Maybe later we'll add a configuration for the project).
3. Currently loading data (via pandas) from a basic csv file (later we'll have to parse logs).
4. The algorithm in retrospect - to filter an already existing log files.
5. kmeans-sklearn.py isn't super relevant right now.
   it generate x random clusters and show 3d implantation of k-means.
6. Actually when we'll run the script we won't make any plots.
   we'll just do the calculations and save the centroids(centers).


How to run?

1. Install packages 2 ways:
 - pip install -r requirements.txt
 - auto import via pycharm

2. Enable sciview
3. Run k-means.py


Java Part : WebApp, logging framework and db

Subsections:
DB:
	1.auotomaticly connect to db or create if needed (create the required directory - DB).
	2.complete Add/Remove from table within DBManager.
	3.does it need its own logger? if so we need to change logger path for it.

HelloServlet:
	1.make sure all looging is actully in JSON format.
	2.write code for doPost/doGet - make sure to add time to the json log.
