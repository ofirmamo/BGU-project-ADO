Some Notes for the project

1. In order to actually see the plots in windows we have to use plt.show().
2. K is configurable (Maybe later we'll add a configuration for the project).
3. Currently loading data (via pandas) from a basic csv file (later we'll have to parse logs).
4. The algorithm in retrospect - to filter an already existing log files.
5. kmeans-sklearn.py isn't super relevant right now.
   it generate x random clusters and show 3d implantation of k-means.
6. Actually when we'll run the script we won't make any plots.
   we'll just do the calculations and save the centroids(centers).


How to run?

1. Install packages 2 ways:
 - pip install -r requirements.txt
